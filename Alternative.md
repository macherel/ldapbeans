## object-ldap-mapping ##
I've just seen another library like this one doing the same.

[Object LDAP mapping](http://code.google.com/p/object-ldap-mapping/) provided mappping between Java POJO classes and LDAP attributes in similar way JPA does.

It provide more verbose syntax and because it is based on spring-ldap, required dependencies take more space.
